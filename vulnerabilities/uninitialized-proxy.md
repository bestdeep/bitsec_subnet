# Uninitialized Proxy
Uninitialized proxy contracts refer to instances where the state variables of a proxy contract are not properly initialized before use. This can create security vulnerabilities, as uninitialized storage variables may contain sensitive data or control critical contract behavior. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by manipulating uninitialized storage variables to gain unauthorized access or execute unintended actions. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to ensure that proxy contracts are properly initialized before they are used in production environments.
