# Weak Access Control
Proper access control measures, such as role-based permissions and strong authentication mechanisms, must be implemented to prevent unauthorized access. Clearly documenting these limitations and abilities of actors within the system can help highlight which actions are at risk for critical vulnerabilities. This kind of documentation can facilitate improved unit testing and the identification of potential conflicts, ensuring that the system operates as intended and minimizes the risks of critical vulnerabilities from a single missing check. Projects should also make sure roles are limited as much as possible in their allowed actions to prevent risks from the web2 world causing irreparable damage to the system as a whole. A compromised private key is incredibly devastating if roles are not granular enough, or if the protocol relies heavily on centralization as a security model.
