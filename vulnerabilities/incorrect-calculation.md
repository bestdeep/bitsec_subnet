# Incorrect Calculation
In smart contracts, incorrect calculations occur when mathematical operations are performed incorrectly, leading to unexpected or incorrect results. These vulnerabilities can arise due to various reasons, such as incorrect assumptions about the precision, range of values, or inconsistent calculations across different parts of the contract. Incorrect calculations can also occur when contracts fail to consider edge cases or handle corner cases properly. In some instances, contracts may not account for extreme values, or fail to handle overflows, or underflows, leading to unexpected behavior or security risks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to manipulate calculations or gain unauthorized advantages within the contract. Proper mathematical precision and careful consideration of corner cases are essential to prevent such vulnerabilities.
