# Oracle/Price Manipulation
Since many protocols are designed to update pricing of assets based on user actions, this can be an obvious but easily overlooked vulnerability, as prices are expected to update based on user interaction. However, when protocols are reliant on those pricing mechanisms, internally or externally, careful consideration should be taken to ensure spot prices cannot be abused. Whether or not price manipulation can be effectively executed can also be highly dependent on current on-chain conditions. Pools with shallow liquidity are at higher risk for manipulation than those which have deeper liquidity. Careful selection of trusted oracles and implementation of secure data verification mechanisms are crucial. Staleness checks, average pricing mechanisms, and read-only reentrancy protections may be important features to implement for robust integration of external pricing mechanisms. Diversification of data sources can also prevent exploits in a single protocol from wreaking havoc on the entire blockchain ecosystem.
