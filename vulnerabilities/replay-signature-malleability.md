# Replay Attacks/Signature Malleability
Replay attacks occur when an attacker replays a valid transaction or message to deceive the smart contract into performing an action more than once. EVM-based chains have access to a primitive ecrecover, which allows a smart contract to verify some data was verified and signed by the recovered address. This native function, however, does not implement any kind of replay protection.
Typically, replay protection is implemented by introducing a nonce (number used once), which is incremented when a signature is used, preventing the original signature from being used again once the nonce is updated. Signature malleability refers to the ability to modify the signature without invalidating it, allowing a signature to be used twice. This can be introduced when encoding data or casting between types, where some part, or bits, of a value are ignored when checking the signature, but used in their entirety to prevent replay attacks.
