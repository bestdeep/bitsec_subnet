# Frontrunning
Frontrunning occurs when an attacker gains an advantage by executing transactions ahead of others, particularly when they have knowledge of pending transactions that are about to be included in a block. In the context of smart contracts, frontrunning can be detrimental in scenarios where transaction order impacts the outcome. For example, in a decentralized exchange, an attacker can observe a victim’s pending transaction intended to buy a specific token at a certain price. They can then quickly submit their own transaction with a higher gas price in order to buy the same token at a lower price before the victim’s transaction executes. This allows the attacker to benefit from the price difference at the expense of the victim. Frontrunning can be executed by anyone observing the mempool, but can also originate from block producers themselves. Some chains have private RPCs which can mitigate risk, but validators and block producers within the private mempools may also have a false assumption of trust. Developers should mitigate potential frontrunning opportunities at the smart contract level and not rely on external mitigations which partially rely on trust or aligned incentives to secure their protocols.
